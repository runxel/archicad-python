# Python for Archicad

> Scripts made to utilize the JSON interface brought to Archicad 24 and up.  


## Prerequisites
- My recommendation is to use just [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and nothing else. This way the setup is the easiest.  
- Officially any installed [Python](https://www.python.org/) of version 3.7 and above should be fine.   
- If not stated otherwise always the [official Python package](https://pypi.org/project/archicad/) is used.
- You can use the Python palette, but you do not have to, if you use a decent editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which you will need for proper editing of scripts anyway.

## Set-up
With 'uv' it is really easy to start editing and setting you up:  
Just create a new "virtual environment" and then install all dependencies:  
```sh
uv venv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

> [!NOTE]
> Have a look on the [JSON interface](https://archicadapi.graphisoft.com/JSONInterfaceDocumentation/#Introduction) and [Python](https://archicadapi.graphisoft.com/archicadPythonPackage/archicad.html) documentation.
